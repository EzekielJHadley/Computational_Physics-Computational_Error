Computational_Physics-Computational_Error
=========================================

This was an assignment in my Computational Physics class on understanding computational round off error.
It was written in C and uses standard C libraries. The main goal of this project was to compare different
ways of calculating the exponential function and then comparing the results with the "exact" result, i.e.
C's built in exponential function.
